# Pi Dashboard (Raspberry Pi Monitoring & 3CX Management)

A lightweight, Flask-powered monitoring and control dashboard tailored for Raspberry Pi deployments in field environments. Ideal for managing 3CX SBC services and viewing live hardware stats from a local web interface or embedded within Cockpit.

---

## 📦 Project Purpose

This project was developed to simplify remote and local management of Raspberry Pis used in business-grade VoIP edge deployments (e.g., 3CX SBC). It provides:

- Real-time system monitoring
- Service controls for 3CX SBC and others
- FQDN/AuthID-based provisioning for SBC
- Power control options
- Local GUI access (via port or Cockpit plugin)

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

- A Flask app serves a web dashboard (originally on port `8080`, now Cockpit embedded)
- A `systemd` service auto-starts the app on boot
- A Cockpit plugin provides GUI access inside the Cockpit admin panel (at `https://<pi-ip>:9090`)
- The app interacts with system tools and services using `psutil`, `hostname`, `systemctl`, and `curl`

---

## 🧱 Requirements

- Raspberry Pi OS (64-bit, Bookworm or Bullseye)
- Python 3.7+
- Flask
- psutil
- Cockpit (installed and active)

Installation will auto-install all dependencies.
